Pemalhost is a multidisciplinary design studio established in 2015 and based in Milan, Italy.

We are interested in exploring new pathways at the intersection between design, data visualization and humanities.
We use the potential of data visualization and information design to provide innovative and engaging visual tools for clients, users and researchers, embracing complexity and aesthetics.
In the past few years we have been involved in research, consulting and teaching activities for several public and private institutions.
